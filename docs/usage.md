# :seedling: Friendly Config - Usage

One of the goals for this library is that a developer should be able to use it without needing to read any documentation. If you know how to write PHP objects, you should not need more than the [basics](#basics) to get started.

However, if this approach feels as too much magic :sparkles:, feel free to read these docs from start to finish. That way, you should learn that all that may seem as magic is just bunch of simple tricks. :wink:
